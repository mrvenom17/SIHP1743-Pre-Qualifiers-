Project Title: Social Media Forensic Tool (SMFT)
Project Description:
The Social Media Forensic Tool (SMFT) is designed to automate the process of examining social media accounts for investigative purposes. By extracting and organizing relevant data, SMFT significantly reduces the risk of human error and improves efficiency.

Key Features:
Automated Data Extraction: Extracts account information, post history, messaging history, media files, and social connections.
Platform-Specific Functionality: Supports Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Telegram, WhatsApp, and Google accounts.
Screenshot Generation: Generates screenshots of key pages and data points.
Data Organization and Analysis: Provides keyword search, time-based filtering, and geolocation mapping.
Cross-Platform Compatibility: Available for both Android and Windows devices.
Technologies and Frameworks:
Backend: Python, Django, PostgreSQL, AWS
Data Collection: Requests, Beautiful Soup, Selenium
AI and Machine Learning: NLTK, Gensim, TensorFlow
Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
Mobile App Development (Optional): React Native, Flutter, or Ionic
Methodology:
Our team will employ a data-driven approach to develop the SMFT. We will utilize Python, leveraging libraries like Beautiful Soup, NLTK, and TensorFlow. The tool will be deployed on a cloud platform for scalability and efficiency.
