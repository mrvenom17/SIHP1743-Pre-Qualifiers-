Social Media Forensic Tool (SMFT)
Project Description:

The Social Media Forensic Tool (SMFT) automates social media account examinations for investigations. It extracts and organizes relevant data, minimizing human error and boosting efficiency.

Key Features:

Automated Data Extraction: Account info, post history, messages, media, and social connections are automatically retrieved.
Platform-Specific Functionality: Supports Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Telegram, WhatsApp, and Google accounts.
Screenshot Generation: Generates screenshots of crucial pages and data.
Data Organization and Analysis: Enables keyword search, time-based filtering, and geolocation mapping.
Cross-Platform Compatibility: Available on both Android and Windows devices.
Technologies and Frameworks:

Backend: Python (Django framework), PostgreSQL database, deployed on AWS cloud platform for scalability.
Data Collection: Requests library, Beautiful Soup for web scraping, Selenium for browser automation.
AI and Machine Learning: NLTK for natural language processing, Gensim for topic modeling, TensorFlow for deep learning.
Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for creating visualizations.
Mobile App Development (Optional): React Native, Flutter, or Ionic can be used for mobile app development.
Methodology:

The team will employ a data-driven approach using Python with libraries like Beautiful Soup, NLTK, and TensorFlow. The tool will be deployed on a cloud platform for efficiency and scalability.

Project Structure:

The project will be organized with the following folders:

src: Contains the source code for the tool.
data: Stores extracted data and generated reports.
docs: Includes documentation, tutorials, and user manuals.
tests: Contains unit and integration tests for code quality assurance.
